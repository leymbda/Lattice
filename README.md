# Lattice

Integrate the Discord Gateway API with your systems over more than just Websockets. Perfect for building gateway bots with serverless platforms like Cloudflare Workers! For more information, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/leymbda/Lattice/wiki).

> [!WARNING]
> As much as I like the idea of this project (and the good progress I've made on it) I've decided to quit working on it as I want to move away from creating things on Discord. Feel free to still get in touch if you have any questions.
